`jiracli` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to interact with Jira, allowing users to efficiently manage tickets across various projects. This tool provides features such as fetching tickets, displaying them in a CLI table with customizable filtering options, updating ticket statuses, creating new tickets, and viewing ticket details â€“ all directly from the command line.

Features

- **Ticket Retrieval:** Retrieve tickets from different Jira projects and display them in a convenient CLI table.

- **Filtering:** Easily filter tickets based on column values in the CLI table, providing a flexible way to focus on specific information.

- **Status Update:** Update the status of Jira tickets directly from the command line.

- **Ticket Creation:** Create new Jira tickets using the CLI, streamlining the process of adding tasks to your projects.

- **Ticket Details:** View detailed information about a specific ticket, helping users get a comprehensive overview of individual issues.

Configuration
-------------

The `jiracli` tool supports a configuration file (`config.yaml`) that allows users to customize various aspects of the application. Here are some of the configurable options:

- **Project Names:** Specify the Jira projects from which tickets should be fetched.

- **Users List:** Optionally provide a list of users to filter tickets specifically for those users.

- **Jira API URL:** Set the URL of your Jira instance to connect and fetch data.

- **Jira API Token:** Securely authenticate with Jira using an API token.

- **Application Options:**
  - **Max Table Entry:** Limit the number of entries displayed in the CLI table.
  - **App Colors:** Customize colors for different parts of the application, such as the table, menu, details form, and prompts.

Installation
------------

To use `jiracli`, follow these steps:

1. **Install the package:** Install the `jiracli` package using your preferred package manager. Open a terminal and run:

```
      pip install jiracli
```

2. **Generate a configuration file:** Create a `config.yaml` file to customize your Jira settings and preferences. You can generate a sample configuration using the `--generate-config` option:

```
      jiracli --generate-config -c config.yaml
```

   Open the generated `config.yaml` file and customize it with your Jira instance details, including project names, users list, Jira API URL, and API token.

3. **Run the `jiracli` tool:** Execute the following command in the terminal:

```
      jiracli -c config.yaml
```

   The application will use the specified configuration to connect to your Jira instance and provide a powerful command-line interface for interacting with your tickets.

4. **Set up an alias for easy access:** For enhanced usability, you can add an alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`). Open the configuration file using a text editor and add the following line:

```
      alias jiracli='jiracli -c /path/to/your/config.yaml'
```

   Replace `/path/to/your/config.yaml` with the actual path to your `config.yaml` file. After saving the configuration file, you can use the `jiracli` alias directly in the terminal:

```
      jiracli
```

   This alias simplifies the command and allows for quick access to your Jira CLI with the specified configuration.
